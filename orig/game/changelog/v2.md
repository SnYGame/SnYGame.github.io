# Version 2 Changelog

Version 2 started when the Scrutinization and Legislation Team (SaLT) was created. Characters and changes now required approval from a majority of the team. While officially starting and announced on the 27th of September 2016, the idea was initially discussed on the 25th and players voted for its members on that day.

Occasionally changes did end up on the document without announcement due the Doc Runners role still existing during this time. Version 2 lasted until the introduction of Attack and Guard Potentials. Unless otherwise stated, these changes were usually announced.
