# Version 1 Changelog

Version 1 is marked by the creation of the character document (now known as the old document). Prior to this event is version 0 and is lost to history. Version 1 is the period in which the game was not very balanced and its end is marked by the formation of the Scrutinization and Legislation Team (SaLT). This version has the largest changelog due to the existence of the Doc Runners which allowed virtually anyone to make any changes to the document without consulting anyone else. These changes were only able to be found using Google Doc's version history feature. Unless otherwise stated, most of these changes were not announced, although there may have been discussion on the topic before the changes were made.
