## Effect

**[Freeze](temp_remove)** / **Petrify**: Makes a target become immune to all status effects but Burn (for **[Freeze](temp_remove)**) / Poison (for **Petrify**). If Burn / Poison is taken, both Burn / Poison and **[Freeze](temp_remove)** / **Petrify** will be cancelled. During **[Freeze](temp_remove)** / **Petrify**â€™s duration, the user will be not able to act, but will receive 10x less damage.

## Trivia

- There was no notice on Discord that this change to Freeze was added. Since it was also removed the day after, once again with no notice, many players at the time did not even know this status existed.
