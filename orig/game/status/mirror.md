## Development

Redrin added Mirror was added on the 15th June, 2016, in order to change one of Banana's spell effect into a status albeit the effect was slightly different. On the 2nd of July, 2016, Banana changed the effect to instead double the damage of basic attacks for unknown reasons. Two days later, Banana's character was reworked and the status itself was removed the day after.

## Origin

The name Mirror was given most likely because the spell that used it was called `Mirror Sign "Trick of the Dark"`. Mirrors create a reflection and as a result, causes a copy of an image to appear.

- Two months after Mirror's removal, percentage potencies could be specified for Attack Up which allows its 1.2.8 effect to be emulated using Attack Up [100%].
