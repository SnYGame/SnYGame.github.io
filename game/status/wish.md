## Effect

**X Wish**: When **Wish** expires or breaks, apply **X** to the affected.

---

## Development

The status was originally a custom status called Break that applied the effect on any form of removal. It was decided that the status was general enough to be added as an official status. A poll was held to determine the new name of the status and Wish was chosen.

---

## Origin

Wish comes from Death Wish and the Pokémon move [Wish](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Wish_(move)), which has a similar delayed application effect.
