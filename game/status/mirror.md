## Effect

**Mirror**: All standard attacks do double damage for a specified number of turns.

## Development

Mirror was created by Redrin in order to change one of Banana's spell effects into a status (albeit with a slightly different effect). Banana later changed the effect of Mirror entirely, but two days after that, Banana's character was reworked and the status was removed on the following day. It is unknown how many (if any) of these changes were communicated, or what the reasons for doing so were.

## Origin

The name Mirror was given most likely because the spell that used it was called `Mirror Sign "Trick of the Dark"`. Mirrors create a reflection and as a result, causes a copy of an image to appear.

## Trivia

- Two months after Mirror's removal, percentage potencies could be specified for Attack Up which allows its [1.2.8](/game/changelog/v1.html#v1.2.8) effect to be emulated using Attack Up [100%].
