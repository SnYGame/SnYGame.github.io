## History

| Version | Changes |
| :---: | --- |
| 1.3.0 | Removed due to redundancy with the effects of Freeze and Poison / Burn. |
| 1.2.0 | Due to durations being removed from the status definition, Perfect Freeze was changed to cause the affected to lose 5 HP each turn in order to distinguish itself from Freeze. |
| 1.0.0 | Perfect Freeze was already in the game at the start of v1.0.0. It had the effect: `Makes a target be unable to act for 9 turns.` |
