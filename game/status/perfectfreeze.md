**Perfect Freeze**: Makes a target be unable to act. Loses 5 HP each turn.

## Development

Initially added some time in v0, Perfect Freeze was originally just [Freeze](/game/status/stun) with a longer duration of 9 turns. On the 14th of June, 2016, base durations were no longer an inherent property of statuses and the effect of also causing the affected to lost 5 HP each turn was added to distinguish itself from Freeze. On the 5th of July, 2016, the status was removed, possibily due to its effect essentially being a combination of Freeze and Burn / Poison.

## Origin

Perfect Freeze comes from [Cirno](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Cirno)'s spell card `Freeze Sign "Perfect Freeze"`. Its original effect may come from the fact that something that is "perfectly" frozen would be harder to thaw. Its damage over time effect may be based off of frostbite or other ideas where extreme cold can be painful or damaging.

## History

| Version | Changes |
| :---: | --- |
| [1.3.0](/game/changelog/v1.html#v1.3.0) | Removed due to redundancy with the effects of [Freeze](/game/status/stun) and Poison / Burn. |
| [1.2.0](/game/changelog/v1.html#v1.2.0) | Due to durations being removed from the status definition, Perfect Freeze was changed to cause the affected to lose 5 HP each turn in order to distinguish itself from [Freeze](/game/status/stun). |
| [1.0.0](/game/changelog/v1.html#v1.0.0) | Perfect Freeze was already in the game at the start of [v1.0.0](/game/changelog/v1.html#v1.0.0). It had the effect: `Makes a target be unable to act for 9 turns.` |

## Trivia

- Even after Perfect Freeze's removal, some players still had reward spells that used its effect.
