## Effect

**Freeze** / **Petrify**: Makes a target become immune to all status effects but Burn (for **Freeze**) / Poison (for **Petrify**). If Burn / Poison is taken, both Burn / Poison and **Freeze** / **Petrify** will be cancelled. During **Freeze** / **Petrify**â€™s duration, the user will be not able to act, but will receive 10x less damage.

## Trivia

- There was no notice on Discord that this change to [Freeze](/game/status/stun) was added. Since it was also removed the day after, once again with no notice, many players at the time did not even know this status existed.
