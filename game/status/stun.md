## Effect

**Stun** / **Freeze [n%]**: The affected has an **n**% chance for their current move to be skipped. **Quick Effects** cannot be used until their next move.

---

## Development

Both Stun, Freeze, and Slow / Paralysis were added some time during v0, all with the same effect of preventing actions. Stun had a duration of 1 to 3 turns while Freeze and Slow / Paralysis had a duration of 5 turns. Slow / Paralysis only had a 50% chance of triggering. Stun, Freeze, and Paralysis were merged into one status while Slow gained a new effect. Freeze also temporarily gained a new effect as an alias as Petrify. Paralysis and its variations were eventually removed as an alias, leaving only Stun and Freeze.

## Origin

Stun, freeze, and paralysis are common statuses effects found in RPGs. Units under these effects have a chance to not be able to act. Paralysis was specifically inspired by [the Pok√©mon games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Paralysis_(status_condition)). The slow effect in games typically slows down movement, but in some turn based games, it may instead lower hit rate or reduce the amount of moves that can be used.
