## Effect

**Priority [n]**: The target cannot use **Quick Effects** in response to actions performed by units with a higher **Priority**. Units with lower **Priority** cannot use **Quick Effects** in response to actions performed by the target. Users without the **Priority** status are considered to have a **Priority** of 0.

## Development

Originally, some enemy spells were tagged with Split Second which had the effect of preventing Quick Effects from being used in response, but this was not standardized. When Quick Effects became popular in early v4 for tanks, the Priority system was suggested as a way of counterint it. However, due to lack of use, it was eventually removed.

## Origin

In card games, priority refers to a player's ability to play cards in response to an effect. Split Second comes from the [Magic the Gathering keyword](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Split_second) with the same effect.
