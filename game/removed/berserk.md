## Effect

**Berserk**: Forces the target to **Attack** a random enemy.

---

## Development

Berserk was added sometime in v0 with the effect of forcing the victim to attack an enemy with a damage increase. Later updates specified that the enemy selected was random and the damage increase was removed due to redundancy with the Dicelock effect. It was later removed since the status could be replicated with Attack Encore && Dizzy [All Enemies].

## Origin

Berserk was inspired by the [status with the same name](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Berserk_(status)) from the older games of Final Fantasy, with a similar effect of boosting damage while forcing the target to use physical attacks.
