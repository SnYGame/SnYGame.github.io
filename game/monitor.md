## Effect

**X Monitor \[Y\]**: When **X** is performed, the affected performs **Y** (without using an action) after **X** has resolved.

## Development

The idea of Monitor was brought up on the 17th of June 2020 as a more general form of Counter and React. It is essentially an "on X do Y" status. It was finally implemented in the [4.8.0](v4#v4.8.0) update on the 9th of October. Originally a good status, it was later changed to be a situational status after realization that **Y** could potentially be a negative effect.

## Origin

Monitor did not have any influences from other games. Although *The Genius of Sappheiros* had a similar effect called Chaser, Monitor was not created with this in mind.
