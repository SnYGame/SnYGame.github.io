## Effect

**Banish**: The affected cannot act, and is unable to be targeted. The affected still undergoes the effects of turn progression (statuses & cooldowns tick down, etc.).

---

## Development

Banished was added some time in v0 with the effect of removing a unit from play. Later on, Banished was able to be inflicted temporarily. It was later renamed to Banish to keep the verb tenses consistent with other statuses.

---

## Origin

Banish or Banishment is an effect in some Final Fantasy games, Dungeons and Dragons, and Yugioh, among others. In these games, the effect removes a unit from battle, sometimes temporarily.
