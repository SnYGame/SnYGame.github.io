## Effect

**Evasion \[n%\]**: When the affected would be hit by an enemy command, there is an **n**% chance that it will not be received by the affected. Roll for **Evasion** once per hit received.

## Development

Evasion was added as a status that gives a 50% chance to dodge an offensive command, later changed to allow for variable potencies. Later on, it was changed to affect all enemy effects rather than just damaging dealing ones.
