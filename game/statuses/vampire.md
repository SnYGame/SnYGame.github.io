## Effect

**Vampire \[n\]**: When the affected successfully deals damage to a target, the affected's HP is increased by **n** of the HP lost by the target.

---

## Development

Vampire was added some time in v0 with the effect of healing by half the damage dealt. Unlike other statuses at the time, there wasn't a default duration and it may have been permanent. Later on, the percentage of health that was restored could be changed.

---

## Origin

Vampires in popular media are creatures that drink human blood. In games, this usually translates as a life draining effect.
