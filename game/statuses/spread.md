## Effect

**Command Spread**: When the affected performs the designated command(s), it will affect all units in the target team instead of its default target(s). If **Spread** does not specify a command, it affects all commands.

## Development

Spread Amulets, later renamed to Spread, was added to allow basic Attacks to hit all enemies. Variations of Spread was later added with Spellspread applying to Spells and Omnispread applying to both Spells and Attacks. After that, it was generalized to Command Spread to be able to apply to any commands.

## Origin

Spread Amulet is one of Reimu's [Skill Cards](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Scarlet_Weather_Rhapsody/Spell_Cards/Reimu_Hakurei#Skill_Card_9) from Scarlet Weather Rhapsody. Spread may be a reference to spread shot, a term used in shooting games to describe a shot type with a large area of effect. Spellspread and Omnispread does not have any inspiration from other games.
