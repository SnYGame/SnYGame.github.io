## Effect

**Invincible**: The affected cannot lose HP.

---

## Development

Invincible was added some time in v0 with the effect of negating damage taken. When the Spellbreak status was introduced, Invincible was the statuses it granted when triggering until the stronger Untouchable was used instead. Invincible went through some minor changes where it ignored self-damage for some time before reverting and then negating any type of HP loss along with their secondary effects.

## Origin

Invincible or Invincibility is a common effect in games that negates harmful effects. It varies in the types of harmful effects it may block, as sometimes it will not block status effects, knockback, or instant death.
