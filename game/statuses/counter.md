## Effect

**Countercommand \[n%\]**: When the affected would be hit by an enemy effect, the affected has an **n**% chance to perform the specified command without using an action after the hit has been registered. If **Counter** does not specify a command, the affected can choose which command to use. Commands that may target the effectâ€™s source must do so - a **Counterattack** must target the enemy that hit you.

---

## Development

Counterattack was added to allow the affected unit to attack an enemy that hit them for extra damage. Later, it was given a variable activation chance. The extra damage was removed to reduce the amount of things that a single status would do. After that, it was generalized to allow the countering with any commands.

## Origin

A counterattack in games is an attack done in response to getting attacked. This is sometimes done automatically or with manual input after a dodge or parry. In some cases, counterattacks will do more damage than a normal attack.
