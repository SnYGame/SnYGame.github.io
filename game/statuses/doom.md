## Effect

**Doom**: When **Doom** expires, the affected's HP becomes 0.

---

## Development

Death Sentence was added some time in v0 with the effect of defeating the affected unit after 3 to 5 turns. The fixed duration range was later removed. Then the effect was changed to trigger when it expire. After that, the effect was changed to set the affected unit's HP to 0 when triggering instead of instantly defeating them. The status's name was later changed to Doom since it was the more commonly used name for this type of effect in other games.

---

## Origin

Death Sentence and Doom are both statuses and spells from other games that instantly kills the affected unit after some time, with Doom being the more common name and Death Sentence being mainly used in the Final Fantasy games.
