## Effect

**Sleep**: The affected cannot act. **Sleep** breaks when the affected takes direct damage.

---

## Development

Sleep was added some time in v0 with the effect of preventing actions until hit. It also had the effect of healing 5 HP each turn. The healing effect was later removed due to redundancy with the Regen status.

## Origin

Sleep is a common status effect in games, most of the time having the same effect of preventing actions. In some games, the effect is removed on hit, usually only physical attacks. Some of these will increase the damage dealt by the hit. In some games the Sleep status does cause the affected unit to heal over time.
