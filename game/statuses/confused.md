## Effect

**Confused**: If the affected can act, the command they perform must be chosen at random. All subsequent requirements for acting (choosing a spell if the **Spell** command is chosen, choosing a target/targets, etc.) are performed as normal.

## Development

Confuse or Confused was added some time during v0, causing the affected unit to randomly perform a basic command against a random target or casting an enemy spell based on the result of a 1d20. A later update changed how it interacts with Berserk with a chance to crit on a 20. It later had its effect changed to that of Dizzy due to the high variance nature of the effect until it was eventually removed. The status was brought back with a much simpler effect later in [4.8.0](v4#v4.8.0).

## Origin

Confuse, confused, or confusion is a status used in many games. Usually the effect randomizes movement or actions including a chance to use abilities or attacks on an unintended target.
