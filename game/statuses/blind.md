## Effect

**Blind \[n%\]**: When the affected would perform a command on a different team, there is an **n**% chance that it will not be received by the specified target. Roll for **Blind** once per hit performed.

## Development

In [1.1.2](v1#v1.1.2), [Blind](block) was introduced as a status that prevents Attacks and had a chance for damaging spells to fail. Since Blind already existed at the time, Failure was added as the inverse of Evasion instead, that causes attacks to have a chance of failing, though Evasion had a fixed potency of 50% at the time. Failure was later changed to only affect the Attack and Guard command before getting removed without seeing any use. In [1.6.1](v1#v1.6.1), Blind was changed to have the original effect of Failure, though it now specifies that it affects offensive commands rather than attacks.

## Origin

Failure has no origin from any other sources. Blind is a common status effect used in games that reduces accuracy or prevents attacks from hitting. In some games this only affects physical attacks and have no effect on magic attacks.
