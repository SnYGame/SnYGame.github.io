## Effect

**Destiny Bond \[partner\]**: If \[partner\] dies, the target dies as well.

---

## Development

It is unknown what this status was originally used for. It was separated into Lifelink and Destiny Bond since the effect did not fit with the name at the time.

---

## Origin

Although Life Link and similar spellings does appear in other games, the original effect was not inspired by any of them. Destiny Bond was inspired by the [Pokémon move](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Destiny_Bond_(move)) with the same name.
